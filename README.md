# Landing page take-home

This project is designed to showcase your ability to interpret a design concept into code while using your judgment to apply web development principles effectively.

Your task is to create a fully functional landing page inspired by the [provided Dribbble design](https://dribbble.com/shots/21938162-Services-scroll-interaction) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A folder with assets has been provided for you to use in your implementation. Note that the `mocks` folder is only for reference—please avoid directly incorporating it in your code.

## Requirements

1. **Landing page implementation**

   - Construct the page layout and styling based on the design reference. Feel free to use placeholder content instead of real text. The focus should be on capturing the structure and visual details of the design.
   - Demonstrate your knowledge of semantic HTML, CSS best practices, and JavaScript semantics.

2. **Background guilloché pattern**

   - Use the provided guilloché (turning/interwoven line) pattern in the background of the page.
   - Apply a subtle animation or movement to the pattern, allowing space for creativity in how you choose to animate or style this element.

3. **Static web page**
   - The focus of this assignment is to take a design mockup to a production-ready static or SSR web page.
   - Vanilla CSS, HTML, and JS are preferred, but you can also use libraries or a meta-framework of your choice. We use Next.js at Plaid, but you can use whatever you're comfortable with.
   - We care about SEO, so the end result should not be a SPA (single-page application).

## Criteria

- **Completeness**: is your implementation complete to the specifications and
  mockups?
- **Correctness**: does it follow HTML, JS and CSS best practices? Is it written
  in a clean, maintainable way?
- **Aesthetically pleasing**: does it closely follow the design mockups?

## Additional considerations

We know there is limited time and that browser compatibility and responsive design are a time-consuming task. Focus on a single platform and environment, like Chrome on macOS.

In addition to replicating the design and adding the animated pattern, this assignment is an opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge of web development best practices. Focus on implementing a performant, accessible, and well-structured page.

See the "future improvements" section in the `TEMPLATE_README.md` file for details regarding suggested improvements.

## Submission

As a guideline, we expect this to take you roughly 4–6 hours to complete, but don't worry if you take a bit more or less time. You have two business days to submit your completed assignment, but let your recruiter know if you feel this will be insufficient!

Complete the `TEMPLATE_README.md` document with the required information. You can then send a link to a private GitHub repository—your recruiter will let you know which GitHub users will need to be provided access to the repository.
